                          This project was part of CS 1300 UI/UX at Brown
                          University. The point of this project was to replicate
                          a common situation faced by designers in industry:
                          designing a solution based on a client request. Our
                          team chose a design problem from a YC startup and
                          completed the entire iterative design process.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Requirements</h4>
                        <p>For this project we completed the following.</p>

                            Identifying and understanding a brief/problem to
                            work on
                          </li>
                          <li>Sketching ideas and divergent ideation</li>

                            Participating in a peer critique in studio and
                            revising the prototype based on feedback
                          </li>
                          <li>Creating or refining a style guide</li>
                          <li>
                            Creating a final, clickable, high-fidelity prototype
                          </li>
                          <li>

                    <i
                      >Partiful is a website and app that allows users to create
                      delightful event pages for birthdays, hangouts, and
                      everything in between. Hosts can invite friends and
                      friends-of-friends when they don't have a phone number or
                      socials. Event pages build hype around the party, allowing
                      guests and hosts to interact with each other. The company

                    <li>
                      Deepening connections with existing and new friends made
                      at recent events
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <strong>CUSTOMER PAIN POINTS:</strong>
                    <li>
                      As a host, it’s difficult to navigate back to a past event
                      to reminisce or utilize helpful Partiful features like
                      Text Blast
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      As a guest, it’s difficult to navigate back to a past
                      event to reminisce, ask for photos, or view already posted
                      photos
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      People want to ask for photos from the event and hosts
                      don’t want this to be a heavy lift
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It’s difficult to find the people you recently partied
                      with to either look them up on another platform
                      (Instagram) or ask friends about them
                    </li>

                  <h4>Questions we asked & answers</h4>
                  <p>
                    We had some questions about how our design should fit into
                    the broader goals of Partiful as a service, particularly in
                    terms of promoting social interaction between users on the
                    app and offering users the ability to upload and view photos
                    taken at an event. Particularly, we wanted to know if we
                    should be thinking about the bigger picture and designing
                    for more connections between users through our design for
                    past events. The founders reiterated to us that their main
                    goal was for us to improve the visibility of past events,
                    but emphasized that we should explore a wide range of
                    solutions and creative ways to solve this problem.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Refined Project Brief</h4>
                  <p>
                    The first round of discussion with the founders cleared up a
                    lot of questions we had. In particular, the founder’s
                    assertion that it was very difficult for the average user to
                    navigate to past events as well as the greater goal of
                    improving the app’s learnability was a great starting point
                    for our design. From here, we began brainstorming our
                    initial sketches (2 for each member) and exploring various
                    ways to improve the visibility of past events (both creative
                    and straight-forward solutions.)

              <h4>Wireframe Interation 1 — description of design decisions</h4>

              <p>
                Initially, past events are not seen at first sight. There are
                five filters, Open Invite, Upcoming, Hosting, Attended and Past
                Events. To solve this, we redesigned the events landing page by
                separating the initial 5 buttons into two sections, Upcoming and
                Past Events. We added a search bar at the top to help users
                easily find any event. For the Upcoming section, we removed the
                add event button as there is already an add event button in the
                nav bar. We designed with in mind different scenarios. If a user
                has 0 upcoming events, the space would be filled up by Open
                Invites, making the page full. If a user has many upcoming
                events, users can still swipe horizontally and after their
                upcoming events they’ll find open invite events.
                <br />
                <br />
                Underneath that is a list of mutuals. with fire emojis and a
                number to indicate the number of shared events between the
                users.
                <br />
                <br />
                Upcoming events can be scrolled horizontally, and Past events
                can be scrolled vertically. The two scrolling directions are
                justified by the fact that usually users have fewer upcoming
                events but many past events. Past events cards are displayed and
                can be filtered by Host, Attend, and can be sorted by factors
                like 1 week, 1 month, 1 years, etc. This section is designed for
                infinite scrolling, we believe that this is the best way of
                using the iphone vertical space and allowing users to view past
                events easily, in an instagram-like way.

              <h4>Critique & Feedback</h4>
              <p> Our success metrics are 1. More users navigating to past events, 2. More activities, 3. More Users connecting with one another from past events. In the current Event page, past events are not visible on the first view, making it harder for users to find and spend time on the page. Our design displays past events on first sight. Our design incorporates functionality that provides users with concrete reasons to navigate back to past events, such as the ability to clone past events, and ways to make mutuals more meaningful by highlighting the number of shared events between users. We created pages for the home page as well as the event page.
                Users can click onto an event and be taken to the event page. We designed for both Host view and Guest view. For the host view, an edit button is now collapsed on the top right corner for intuitive editing. We included a ‘cloning’  button after conducting a user interview with a Partiful host,  who mentioned that their pain point is that it is frustrating to add the same invitees from a previous event. An idea arose which is to duplicate an existing party template. This also incentivizes users to return to past events. We moved Text Blast to next to the Guest list, an intuitive place to text invitees.

                    <h4>Our Changes and Rationale</h4>
                  <p>
                    In our previous wire frames, we included ideas about remaking the event page itself, profile page, mutual contacts page. The feedback clearly explained that our scope is solely to focus on past events in the homepage. Therefore, we had to only work on redesigning homepages going forward. We also realized that their main goal with this project is to be creative and design unique ideas for displaying past events. We wanted to work on discoverability. This means that a user can easily see all the actions they can do from the get go, therefore, past events should be easily navigable for the user.
<br> <br>
To solve the problems, we redesigned the events landing page by separating the initial 5 buttons into two sections, Upcoming and Past Events. We added a search bar at the top to help users easily find any event. For the Upcoming section, we removed the add event button as there is already an add event button in the nav bar. We designed with in mind different scenarios. </p>

                    <h4>Explanation of Design Choices</h4>
                  <p>
                    Our mid check-in with Partiful was to focus only on the main events page and think of other ways to display the information. Based on that feedback, we came up with three alternatives for the main page.
                    <br> <br>
                    The first design is similar to the lo-fi that we presented last week. We have upcoming, mutual and past events as three sections. We moved past events to the front page so it’s shown at first sight. In the case that there are upcoming events, Upcoming can be scrolled horizontally and past events can be scrolled vertically with infinite scrolling. The base case is covered so that if there are no upcoming events, then this slot will be replaced by an open invite event indicated by the dotted container. In the case of there are no upcoming events or open invite events, this space will be filled with an add event button.
                    <br> <br>
                    The second sign is inspired by social media feeds, because we know that Partiful intends on becoming more of a social media platform.  For each host, past events and upcoming, we have notifications. If a user uploads an image then a notification would pop up for past events. If a party guest RSVPs  then a host would see a notification for that page. You can scroll down and look at all of the notifications and also press show less to collapse them. The rationale behind is that It prompts users to revisit a past event to look at updates. 
                    <br> <br>
                    And then lastly our third design, map, is inspired by snap maps. The idea is that when you open the app you will see upcoming events and exactly where they are located. Next to each event, location, time and attend status are also shown. Similarly, if the user navigates into the past events tab,  they can also keep track of where they have been. We wanted to implement past events like a heat map so users can also see where the party super hosts are and where the hottest activities are located nearby.

                    and you have not paid for a full-time web design agency.
                    Occasionally we will help with small tweaks, but these
                    requests will be put on a lower priority due to their
                    nature. Support is also 100% optional and we provide it for
                    your connivence, so please be patient, polite and
                    respectful.

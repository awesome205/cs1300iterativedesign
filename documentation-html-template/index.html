                          This project was part of CS 1300 UI/UX at Brown
                          University. The point of this project was to replicate
                          a common situation faced by designers in industry:
                          designing a solution based on a client request. Our
                          team chose a design problem from a YC startup and
                          completed the entire iterative design process.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Requirements</h4>
                        <p>For this project we completed the following.</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            Identifying and understanding a brief/problem to
                            work on
                          </li>
                          <li>Sketching ideas and divergent ideation</li>
                          <li>
                            Participating in a peer critique in studio and
                            revising the prototype based on feedback
                          </li>
                          <li>Creating or refining a style guide</li>
                          <li>
                            Creating a final, clickable, high-fidelity prototype
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Presenting your clickable prototype to your client
                            and receiving feedback
                          </li>
                          <li>

                            client feedback
                          </li>

                    <i
                      >Partiful is a website and app that allows users to create
                      delightful event pages for birthdays, hangouts, and
                      everything in between. Hosts can invite friends and
                      friends-of-friends when they don't have a phone number or
                      socials. Event pages build hype around the party, allowing
                      guests and hosts to interact with each other. The company

                    <strong>CUSTOMER MOTIVATIONS:</strong>
                    <li>
                      Deepening connections with existing and new friends made
                      at recent events
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <strong>CUSTOMER PAIN POINTS:</strong>
                    <li>
                      As a host, it’s difficult to navigate back to a past event
                      to reminisce or utilize helpful Partiful features like
                      Text Blast
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      As a guest, it’s difficult to navigate back to a past
                      event to reminisce, ask for photos, or view already posted
                      photos
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      People want to ask for photos from the event and hosts
                      don’t want this to be a heavy lift
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It’s difficult to find the people you recently partied
                      with to either look them up on another platform
                      (Instagram) or ask friends about them
                    </li>

                  <h4>Questions we asked & answers</h4>
                  <p>
                    We had some questions about how our design should fit into
                    the broader goals of Partiful as a service, particularly in
                    terms of promoting social interaction between users on the
                    app and offering users the ability to upload and view photos
                    taken at an event. Particularly, we wanted to know if we
                    should be thinking about the bigger picture and designing
                    for more connections between users through our design for
                    past events. The founders reiterated to us that their main
                    goal was for us to improve the visibility of past events,
                    but emphasized that we should explore a wide range of
                    solutions and creative ways to solve this problem.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Refined Project Brief</h4>
                  <p>
                    The first round of discussion with the founders cleared up a
                    lot of questions we had. In particular, the founder’s
                    assertion that it was very difficult for the average user to
                    navigate to past events as well as the greater goal of
                    improving the app’s learnability was a great starting point
                    for our design. From here, we began brainstorming our
                    initial sketches (2 for each member) and exploring various
                    ways to improve the visibility of past events (both creative
                    and straight-forward solutions.)

              <h4>Wireframe Interation 1 — description of design decisions</h4>

              <p>
                Initially, past events are not seen at first sight. There are
                five filters, Open Invite, Upcoming, Hosting, Attended and Past
                Events. To solve this, we redesigned the events landing page by
                separating the initial 5 buttons into two sections, Upcoming and
                Past Events. We added a search bar at the top to help users
                easily find any event. For the Upcoming section, we removed the
                add event button as there is already an add event button in the
                nav bar. We designed with in mind different scenarios. If a user
                has 0 upcoming events, the space would be filled up by Open
                Invites, making the page full. If a user has many upcoming
                events, users can still swipe horizontally and after their
                upcoming events they’ll find open invite events.
                <br />
                <br />
                Underneath that is a list of mutuals. with fire emojis and a
                number to indicate the number of shared events between the
                users.
                <br />
                <br />
                Upcoming events can be scrolled horizontally, and Past events
                can be scrolled vertically. The two scrolling directions are
                justified by the fact that usually users have fewer upcoming
                events but many past events. Past events cards are displayed and
                can be filtered by Host, Attend, and can be sorted by factors
                like 1 week, 1 month, 1 years, etc. This section is designed for
                infinite scrolling, we believe that this is the best way of
                using the iphone vertical space and allowing users to view past
                events easily, in an instagram-like way.

              <h4>Critique & Feedback</h4>
              <p>
                Our success metrics are 1. More users navigating to past events,
                2. More activities, 3. More Users connecting with one another
                from past events. In the current Event page, past events are not
                visible on the first view, making it harder for users to find
                and spend time on the page. Our design displays past events on
                first sight. Our design incorporates functionality that provides
                users with concrete reasons to navigate back to past events,
                such as the ability to clone past events, and ways to make
                mutuals more meaningful by highlighting the number of shared
                events between users. We created pages for the home page as well
                as the event page. Users can click onto an event and be taken to
                the event page. We designed for both Host view and Guest view.
                For the host view, an edit button is now collapsed on the top
                right corner for intuitive editing. We included a ‘cloning’
                button after conducting a user interview with a Partiful host,
                who mentioned that their pain point is that it is frustrating to
                add the same invitees from a previous event. An idea arose which
                is to duplicate an existing party template. This also
                incentivizes users to return to past events. We moved Text Blast
                to next to the Guest list, an intuitive place to text invitees.

                  <h4>Our Changes and Rationale</h4>
                  <p>
                    In our previous wire frames, we included ideas about
                    remaking the event page itself, profile page, mutual
                    contacts page. The feedback clearly explained that our scope
                    is solely to focus on past events in the homepage.
                    Therefore, we had to only work on redesigning homepages
                    going forward. We also realized that their main goal with
                    this project is to be creative and design unique ideas for
                    displaying past events. We wanted to work on
                    discoverability. This means that a user can easily see all
                    the actions they can do from the get go, therefore, past
                    events should be easily navigable for the user.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    To solve the problems, we redesigned the events landing page
                    by separating the initial 5 buttons into two sections,
                    Upcoming and Past Events. We added a search bar at the top
                    to help users easily find any event. For the Upcoming
                    section, we removed the add event button as there is already
                    an add event button in the nav bar. We designed with in mind
                    different scenarios.

                  <h4>Explanation of Design Choices</h4>
                  <p>
                    Our mid check-in with Partiful was to focus only on the main
                    events page and think of other ways to display the
                    information. Based on that feedback, we came up with three
                    alternatives for the main page.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The first design is similar to the lo-fi that we presented
                    last week. We have upcoming, mutual and past events as three
                    sections. We moved past events to the front page so it’s
                    shown at first sight. In the case that there are upcoming
                    events, Upcoming can be scrolled horizontally and past
                    events can be scrolled vertically with infinite scrolling.
                    The base case is covered so that if there are no upcoming
                    events, then this slot will be replaced by an open invite
                    event indicated by the dotted container. In the case of
                    there are no upcoming events or open invite events, this
                    space will be filled with an add event button.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The second sign is inspired by social media feeds, because
                    we know that Partiful intends on becoming more of a social
                    media platform. For each host, past events and upcoming, we
                    have notifications. If a user uploads an image then a
                    notification would pop up for past events. If a party guest
                    RSVPs then a host would see a notification for that page.
                    You can scroll down and look at all of the notifications and
                    also press show less to collapse them. The rationale behind
                    is that It prompts users to revisit a past event to look at
                    updates.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    And then lastly our third design, map, is inspired by snap
                    maps. The idea is that when you open the app you will see
                    upcoming events and exactly where they are located. Next to
                    each event, location, time and attend status are also shown.
                    Similarly, if the user navigates into the past events tab,
                    they can also keep track of where they have been. We wanted
                    to implement past events like a heat map so users can also
                    see where the party super hosts are and where the hottest
                    activities are located nearby.

                <h4>Explanation of Style Guide Choices</h4>
                <p>
                  The team received a style guide from Partiful which included a
                  DropBox folder with fonts and Figma mockups of their homepage,
                  settings, profile, and event page customization. Partiful
                  designed their style guide with their ethos in mind “fun,”
                  “creative” and “exciting” for the user. This is demonstrated
                  by their font choices of Syne and TWK Lausanne Pan Family
                  which evoke a sense of professionalism coupled with elation.
                  Partiful also designed their color scheme around light blue,
                  purple, and pink. The light blue and pink are high energy
                  colors which drive a sense of enthusiasm when using the app.
                  Purple as a tertiary color suggests mystery and a feeling of
                  wonder. The Partiful style guide was focused more on the fonts
                  and actual design assets of their IOS app. We created a new
                  style guide which highlights the fonts, colors, and a few
                  design elements (buttons, filters, and event labels). All
                  three versions of the high-fidelity design adhere to the WCAG
                  AA accessibility guidelines. To ensure optimal contrast
                  between text and backgrounds, we primarily used white and
                  light gray for our text colors. We also made use of shadow
                  effects and grouped UI cards to optimize page organization.
                  Additionally, following the existing design system from
                  Partiful, we incorporated emojis and symbols in addition to
                  information to enhance the accessibility and readability of
                  each component. Most of the interaction designs followed
                  standard mobile interaction gestures, such as horizontal and
                  vertical scrolling and pressing on an item card.

                    Part 6: Final Feedback
                    <hr />
                  </h2>

                
                <!-- end col -->
                <p>
                  <strong>Basic:</strong>
                  The founders thought we handled this version well to split the
                  5 filters into three categories, which makes more intuitive
                  sense. They prompted us to consider if we want to expose all
                  guest lists from the top level for an upcoming event, as then
                  it would eliminate the need for users to click onto an event.
                  It could be cool for Right Now events to have all the
                  information displayed, but have other upcoming events be
                  smaller cards without all the information displayed. They
                  liked having mutuals displayed on the main page, as it
                  encourages interactions between mutuals (including sending
                  emojis and chatting).
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Feed:</strong>
                  The founders view the feed as a separate page in addition to
                  the main page, but a little too cluttered as the landing page
                  itself. It would be interesting to explore an activities feed.
                  They encouraged us to take this concept and play on the
                  hierarchy of information. They also prompted us to think about
                  other ways to display these notifications - do we need
                  timestamps for each card? What if each event could be
                  ‘pinched’ to expand notifications? They wanted us to explore
                  other gestures for the iOS app. For example, users can tap an
                  event card and underneath there are a bunch of user avatars
                  stacked next to each other, which can be clicked on to expand
                  to see notifications. They do believe that this feed design
                  would incentivise people to click on event cards.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Map:</strong>
                  This proposal was received with enthusiasm, as Grace, one of
                  the designers, had previously pitched a similar idea. They
                  would be interested in seeing how we can combine past events
                  and upcoming events into one map, especially how we would
                  visualize past events as a heat map. They really enjoy the
                  current visualization of events, as it reminds them of a
                  pulsing animation. Perhaps if an event is upcoming it can
                  pulse more than other events.

                In conclusion, this project was a great experience in learning
                how to work with a team towards a final goal. We really enjoyed
                getting to work with Partiful and brainstorming various ideas
                for their Past Events page, especially because many of us were
                already familiar with the app, and getting direct feedback from
                the founders was a great opportunity for us to experience what
                it may be like working in a real world design team. As a team,
                working through the steps of sketching, lo-fi wireframes, hi-fi
                prototyping, then receiving feedback was invaluable to the
                development of our design skills and ability to work with
                others.
